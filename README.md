# Avoiding Pitfalls in Epidemic Modeling — Companion Repository

Companion code and materials for the book *Avoiding Pitfalls in Epidemic
Modeling: An Introduction to Formulating, Analyzing, and Fitting Models*, by
**James M. Hyman**, **Zhuolin Qu**, and **Ling Xue** (Springer,
Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics series — under review).

**Rendered companion site:** <https://machyman.github.io/hyman2026avoiding>

**Tracks book v2_62_1.** This line records the manuscript version this repository
was last synchronised against, so drift between the book and the code is visible
rather than silent. If it is many versions behind the current draft, the code here
may not match the book's printed numbers.

> **The book is under review with Springer.** The manuscript is not hosted
> here; it will be available from the publisher, with a link added **pending
> permission**. See [`book/`](book/).

## What's here

This repository collects the reproducible code behind the book's figures and
numerical results, organized to match the book's Appendix B:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) | Per-chapter scripts that reproduce each chapter's figures and computations (`ch03/`, `ch06/`–`ch11/`) |
| [`src/`](src/) | Shared Python modules — the `sir_i_model.py` integrator used across chapters |
| [`code/`](code/python/ch10_sensitivity/) | Standalone modules the book cites by path — currently the Chapter 10 sensitivity module |
| [`capstone-projects/`](capstone-projects/) | The book's chapter capstone projects, one directory per project |
| [`data/`](data/) | Provenance and pointers for the empirical case-study datasets |
| [`labs/`](labs/) | Guided lab notebooks *(in preparation)* |
| [`book/`](book/) | Book availability and citation *(manuscript not hosted — under review)* |

Fuller narrated teaching notebooks and the lab set are being finalized alongside
the book.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/machyman/hyman2026avoiding
cd hyman2026avoiding
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir -p figs
python notebooks/ch07/ch7_figures.py     # writes figures to figs/
```

Run scripts from the repository root. Anything involving randomness is seeded,
so results are reproducible; the conventions are documented in
[`REPRODUCIBILITY.md`](REPRODUCIBILITY.md).

## Who it's for

Graduate students and researchers learning to formulate, analyze, and fit
compartmental epidemic models — and instructors teaching from the book. The code
is meant to be read alongside the corresponding chapter.

## Citing
